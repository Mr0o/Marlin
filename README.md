# Marlin firmware
This is simply a fork of the [Marlin firmware](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) with my personal configuration for my Ender 3.
I am using this with the Marlin Ender 3 example configuration, but with BLtouch and ABL enabled. I have also inserted my own custom boot screen, because I thought it would be cool.

I used this [post](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/19617/configuring-marlin-2-x-with-ender-3-4-2-2-and-bltouch) to set up the build environment as well as what settings needed to be changed.

Built for the Ender 3 with a BLtouch and a 4.2.2 Creality board.

I would recommend compiling Marlin yourself, but if you would like, the firmware bin file has been made available in the [Release tab](https://github.com/Mr0o/Marlin/releases/tag/2.1.2.1).
